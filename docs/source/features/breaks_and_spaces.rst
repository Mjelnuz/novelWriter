Page Breaks and Spaces

In addition, the editor supports a few additional types of white spaces:

* A non-breaking space can be inserted with :kbd:`Ctrl+K`, :kbd:`Space`.
* Thin spaces are also supported, and can be inserted with :kbd:`Ctrl+K`, :kbd:`Shift+Space`.
* Non-breaking thin space can be inserted with :kbd:`Ctrl+K`, :kbd:`Ctrl+Space`.

These are all insert features, and the **Insert** menu has more. The keyboard shortcuts for them
are also listed in :ref:`docs_features_shortcuts`.

Non-breaking spaces are highlighted by the syntax highlighter with an alternate coloured
background, depending on the selected theme.

.. tip::

   Non-breaking spaces are for instance the correct type of space to separate a number from its
   unit. Generally, non-breaking spaces are used to prevent line wrapping algorithms from adding
   line breaks where they shouldn't.
